This project was submitted as part of the MS Business Analytics Coursework at Columbia University by Amrita Dutta, Malin Ortenblad, Metika Sikka and Sanchya Sahay.
 
 The aim of the project was to make a content based movie recommendation system.
 
 4 approaches were tried:
 
1. Shortest Path (by movie title)
2. Cosine similarity (by movie title)
3. TF-IDF (by keywords)
4. Cosine similarity (by keywords and genre)

The data was scraped using the TMDB API availible at: https://www.themoviedb.org/.

This repo contains the codes, final presentation, folder of the word clouds and video of the dynamic plotly graph.
